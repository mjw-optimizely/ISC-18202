# ISC-18202

This is a proof-of-concept that exercises 3DS for Stripe payments. It's built on ExpressJS/Node.js, hopefully you know how to use those tools. You'll need your own Stripe account, and you'll need to use this in conjunction with the included Postman export. It is just a POC, it's not very robust or flexible.
